Server:
socket() is called master socket file descriptor and responsible for creating handlers corresponded to the incoming client's
connection initiation request. Once the request arrives, the socket() function forks a handler function for
the client to communicate with the server. Each client request has its own handler function inside the server.

that if the sender process (which is in the same machine as receiver) sends the data destined to socket "~/Desktop/socket",
then such data needs to be delivered to this process
accept() and read() system calls are blocking ones.

Client:
